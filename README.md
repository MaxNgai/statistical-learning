# statistical-learning

This is a project created when one learning the famous statistic manual 《An introduction to statistical learning - Gareth James》.
it includes experiment reproduction and most of the assignment(applied, no conceptual) in every Chapter of the book.
What is special is that the code is in Java and using Junit test method to instance each assignment and experiment. Due to limited time and my poor math skill as well as the short of ease-using jar for statistics, some complicated exercise of the book are implemented by Python.
Also it provides an easy access to the model and tools encapsulated that are mentioned in the book so as to make somebody use them more conveniently.

On the initial purposed, it was intended to finish the whole project in java because in this way it enables me to implement so algorithm from zero to one.
But as the study went deep, the algo is far complicated and difficult for a person without solid math background. So i have to switch to python, which is
ease-using, but lacks more fun.

People can download the project to run and to cross-validate your java code is correct.

because the access to github in china is very unstable, so i won't be able to read the github message in time. Further discussion please email me max_ngai@qq.com
